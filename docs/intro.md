# Docs Intro

The following guides, tools, & automations are for the new and old when it comes to truenas.

I been running [truenas scale](/docs/manual/intro/my-os-of-choice#truenas-scale) for nearly two years and I been closely working with [truecharts](https://truecharts.org/), a community catalog for scale as support staff ðŸ˜„ and constant contributor to the code to bring in new stuff to test and break ðŸ˜….

These guides can be edited by _YOU_ so I am not perfect and I may make mistakes here. Self hosting and these guides will always be actively changing due to industry or best practices.

I hope you learn something new and maybe you teach me something too!
