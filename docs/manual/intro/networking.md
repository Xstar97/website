My favorite domain provider is [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). They offer a ton of services for FREE that any self hoster **should** use. You dont have to even purchase a domain from them at all to use their services.

- Proxy Domain DNS records(hiding your public IP for more anonymity and security)
- DNS
- Zero Trust(free tier)
- Wildcard Letsencrypt certs.
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Email Routing/Email Security
- Caching/always-online-
