# Hardware Recommendations

:::tip NOTES
You can use any hardware that you want and don't have to conform to these products or this list.
:::

- SSD's solid state drives.
  - My best recommendation for consumer level SSDs will be samsung.
    - Use m.2 SSDs for the boot drive(s).

- HDD, mass storage mechanical drives.
  - Highly recommend the seagate enterprise drives 16 TB or more.
    - very cost effective for $ USD per TB.
