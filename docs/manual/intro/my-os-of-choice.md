# What OS to install for a homelab?

Well glad you _didn't_ asked, I highly recommend [Truenas Scale](#truenas-scale) as a _appliance_ NAS OS. 

For a general NAS experience without all the bells and whistles then [Truenas Core](#truenas-core) will be a better option for you.

___

## Truenas Scale

A debian based appliance NAS OS.

___

## Truenas Core

A freeBSD based appliance NAS OS.
